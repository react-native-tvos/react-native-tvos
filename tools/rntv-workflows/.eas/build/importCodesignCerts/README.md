This is a custom build function for EAS Build, used to import the required keychain for signing Apple frameworks.

Code is derived from https://github.com/Apple-Actions/import-codesign-certs

This function is used in the [build-rncore-apple.yml](../build-rncore-apple.yml) workflow.

Please refer to [this tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/custom-builds/functions/) for more information on how to write custom build functions.

If you don't know what custom builds are or how to use them, refer to the [custom builds documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/custom-builds/get-started/).
