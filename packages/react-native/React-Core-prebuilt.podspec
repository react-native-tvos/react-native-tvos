  # We vend two xcframeworks that ship together in the prebuilt tarball:
  #  - React.xcframework: the compiled core. Its per-slice React.framework carries
  #    every <React/...> header + the framework module map, so `#import <React/...>`
  #    and `@import React;` resolve through FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS automatically.
  #  - ReactNativeHeaders.xcframework: headers-only. Carries every other namespace
  #    (<react/...>, <yoga/...>, folly, glog, ...). Its headers are flattened into a
  #    top-level Headers/ (see prepare_command) and exposed via the standard pod
  #    header search path. (<hermes/...> is supplied by the hermes-engine pod here;
  #    it is folded into ReactNativeHeaders only on the SwiftPM consumer side.)
