/**
 * Lets a native module register an AndroidX [ActivityResultContract] and receive results without
 * any changes to the consumer's `MainActivity`. Mirrors
 * `androidx.activity.ComponentActivity.registerForActivityResult`, except registration is legal at
 * any time: the returned launcher binds to the real registry once a host Activity resumes.
 *
 * Every registration carries a key that must be unique within the `ReactContext` and stable across
 * process death (AndroidX replays a restored result to whichever registration reproduces the same
 * key). The default key `"<owner class>:<contract class>"` lets unrelated libraries register the
 * same stock contract without colliding; a collision throws [IllegalStateException] at registration
 * time, and the keyed overload (which appends to that scope, not replaces it) resolves it.
