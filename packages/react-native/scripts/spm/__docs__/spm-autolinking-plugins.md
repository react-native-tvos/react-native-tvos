How a framework with its own module system — Expo is the first consumer —
contributes to the SwiftPM autolinking graph that `npx react-native spm`
generates. See [spm-scripts.md](./spm-scripts.md) for the base tool.

## Why a plugin (not a static list or a post-process)

The documented extension points don't cover a framework:

- `spm.modules` in `react-native.config.js` is a **static** list of simple
  source modules. A framework discovers its modules **dynamically** (scanning
  `node_modules`), generates a **module registry**, and ships mixed
  Swift/ObjC/C++ modules (e.g. `ExpoModulesCore`) that `spm scaffold` can't
  handle.
- A one-shot **post-process** of the generated `Package.swift` is **clobbered on
  the next sync**: the Xcode [auto-sync hooks](./spm-scripts.md#auto-sync)
  re-run autolinking on every dependency change. A framework's contribution must
  run _whenever autolinking runs_.

A plugin is exactly that. It is invoked from `generate-spm-autolinking.js`'s
`main()` — the single function that both `add` / `update` **and** the build-time
`sync` call — so the contribution is regenerated on every build and never goes
stale.

(This is the SwiftPM analog of the seams CocoaPods gave Expo: the Podfile,
`use_expo_modules!`, and `react_native_post_install` hooks.)

## Discovery — transitive, zero app config

A dependency opts in from its **own** `react-native.config.js`, so installing
the framework is enough (mirrors how CocoaPods pulls in `use_expo_modules!`
transitively):

```js
// node_modules/expo/react-native.config.js
module.exports = {
  spm: {autolinkingPlugin: './spm/autolinking-plugin.js'},
};
```

The autolinker already walks every dependency's `react-native.config.js`; any
that declares `spm.autolinkingPlugin` is `require`d and invoked. No app-level
registration or allowlist is required.

**Opt-out escape hatch.** An app can exclude a plugin from its own
`react-native.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  spm: {denyPlugins: ['some-framework']}, // npm names to skip
};
```

## The contract

A plugin is a function exported from the module named above
(`module.exports = fn`, or `default` / `plugin` named exports also work):

```js
module.exports = function plugin(context) {
  return {
    packageDependencies: [
      // Local package (e.g. a scanned module dir) …
      {
        name: 'ExpoModulesCore',
        path: '../../../node_modules/expo-modules-core/ios',
      },
      // … or a remote/published package:
      // {name: 'SomePkg', url: 'https://…/SomePkg.git', version: '1.2.3'},
    ],
    productDependencies: [
      // Linked by the app's AutolinkedAggregate target:
      {name: 'ExpoModulesCore', package: 'ExpoModulesCore'},
    ],
    generatedSources: [
      // e.g. the generated module registry, registered with codegen:
      {path: 'build/generated/expo/ExpoModulesProvider.swift'},
    ],
    flavoredFrameworks: [
      // Precompiled dynamic XCFrameworks that come in mandatory Debug/Release
      // pairs. RN validates and stages both outside the SwiftPM graph.
      {
        id: 'expo-modules-core',
        frameworkName: 'ExpoModulesCore',
        linkage: 'dynamic',
        flavors: {
          debug: '/…/output/debug/xcframeworks/ExpoModulesCore.xcframework',
          release: '/…/output/release/xcframeworks/ExpoModulesCore.xcframework',
        },
      },
    ],
    watchPaths: [
      // Inputs whose edits must re-trigger the auto-sync — the plugin's own
      // manifest and per-module config (absolute paths, dirs or files):
      '/…/node_modules/expo/Package.swift',
      '/…/node_modules/expo/expo-module.config.json',
    ],
    scriptPhases: [
      // Build-time shell phases on the app target — SwiftPM's missing
      // `script_phase`:
      {
        id: 'expo-constants.generate-app-config',
        name: 'Generate Expo App Config',
        script: '"$NODE_BINARY" .../createExpoConfig.js',
        position: 'beforeCompile', // default: 'end'
        inputPaths: ['$(SRCROOT)/../app.config.js'],
        outputPaths: ['$(DERIVED_FILE_DIR)/EXConstants.bundle/app.config'],
        alwaysOutOfDate: true,
      },
    ],
  };
};
```

### `flavoredFrameworks` — per-configuration precompiled frameworks

Each entry is
`{id, frameworkName, linkage: 'dynamic', flavors: {debug, release}}`. Both
flavor paths must be absolute and present when `spm add` or `spm update` runs.
The framework and executable names, public headers, and platform slices must
agree across flavors. Static binaries, nested frameworks, duplicate IDs, and
duplicate embedded framework names are fatal.

The declarations are recorded to
`<outputDir>/.spm-plugin-flavored-frameworks.json`, normalized into the same
immutable app-local slots as React Native, and added to Xcode's exact linker and
embed settings. They are not emitted as SwiftPM product dependencies. Adding or
removing one requires `spm update`; the build-time `spm sync` intentionally does
not mutate runtime framework settings.

### `watchPaths` — plugin staleness inputs

`watchPaths` is an array of **absolute** paths (dirs **or** files) the Xcode
auto-sync hooks watch to decide whether they must re-sync. RN already watches
each module's source dir plus every npm dep's checked-in `Package.swift` and
`.react-native/` dir; a plugin adds the inputs only it knows about — e.g.
`packages/expo/Package.swift`, `expo-module.config.json`, and per-module
manifests. On the next build the phase re-syncs when a watched **file** is newer
than the last sync, a watched **dir** has a newer child, or a watched path has
**vanished** (a rename forces a re-sync so the config error surfaces).

Unlike `flavoredFrameworks`, watch paths are best-effort: a non-array is ignored
with a warning (never fatal), and each non-string / empty / **relative** entry
is dropped with a warning. Absolute-only, because the generated phase tests
these paths with no cwd context. The kept paths are folded into
`<outputDir>/.spm-sync-watch-paths` alongside RN's own, then deduped and sorted.

### `scriptPhases` — build-time shell phases on the app target

SwiftPM has no equivalent of CocoaPods' `script_phase`, so a framework that must
run a script during the app's build — `expo-constants` writing
`EXConstants.bundle/app.config` is the first consumer — declares it here. Each
entry is recorded to `<outputDir>/.spm-plugin-script-phases.json`, which
`spm add` / `spm update` reads to emit one `PBXShellScriptBuildPhase` per entry
on the injected app target:

| Key                          | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                         | **Stable key** — the ledger entry and the deterministic UUID seed. Charset `/^[@A-Za-z0-9_./-]+$/`, so a scoped npm name like `@expo/log-box` is a valid id; a `:` is not, because the id is hashed into the UUID seed as `plugin:<id>` and the separator must stay unambiguous. Renaming it is a _remove + add_, not a rename. |
| `name`                       | The phase's display name in Xcode. Any non-empty single-line string — see **Hostile names** below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `script`                     | The shell body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `position`                   | `'beforeCompile'` or `'end'`. Optional, default `'end'` — see **Placement** below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `inputPaths` / `outputPaths` | Optional Xcode input/output file lists, which is what lets Xcode skip an up-to-date phase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `alwaysOutOfDate`            | Optional; when `true` the phase runs on every build regardless of its file lists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

**Placement.** `'end'` appends at the true end of the target's `buildPhases` —
after the app's own JS-bundle phase. `'beforeCompile'` lands directly after the
"Sync SPM Autolinking" phase, which stays first because it regenerates the
content everything else reads, and always **before Sources**: React Native never
re-seats its own sync phase, so if you have dragged that below Sources your
`beforeCompile` phases are seated ahead of Sources instead of following it.
Phases sharing a position keep their declared order.

**Position is enforced on every sync.** `add`/`update` compares where the plugin
phases actually sit in `buildPhases` against the declared placement and, **only
when the two differ**, lifts their membership lines and re-seats them in
declared order. So changing `position` — or swapping two phases that share one —
takes effect on the next `spm add`/`update`, with no remove + re-add. When they
agree nothing is rewritten, which is what keeps an unchanged declaration
re-syncing to a byte-identical project. The consequence worth knowing: a phase
you **drag somewhere else in Xcode is moved back** to its declared position on
the next sync, because the plugin's declaration is the source of truth. Only the
`id` behaves differently — it is a key, not a label, so renaming it is a remove

- add.

Phases are injected by `spm add` / `spm update` **only**. The build-time `sync`
rewrites the sidecar but never touches the `.xcodeproj`, so a newly declared
phase appears on the next `add`/`update`, not on the next build. Each phase's
UUID is derived from its `id` and recorded in the `.spm-injected.json` marker's
`scriptPhases` map, so a re-run refreshes the phase's `name`, `script`, path
lists, `alwaysOutOfDate` and placement in place, `update` removes phases that
left the sidecar, and `deinit` reverts all of them.

Validation is **fatal**, like `flavoredFrameworks` and unlike `watchPaths`: a
non-array `scriptPhases`, a malformed entry, or a duplicate `id` (within one
plugin or across plugins) aborts the run. A silently dropped phase would produce
a green build whose generated content was never written — a runtime failure with
no build-time signal — and two phases sharing an `id` would collapse onto one
ledger key. `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` are rejected as ids even
though the charset admits them: as keys of that ledger they never become own
properties, so the phase would look recorded, disappear when the marker is
serialized, and be unremovable by `deinit`.

**Hostile names.** A `name` reaches the project file twice. In the `name` field
— what Xcode displays — it lands verbatim, escaped as an OpenStep string, so any
single-line string is expressible. Beside the phase's UUID, on the object's
definition line and on its `buildPhases` member line, it also becomes a
`/* … */` comment; those comments are cosmetic (Xcode regenerates them from the
`name` field) but the text around them is scanned by delimiter, so the name is
**normalized** there: `{}(),;="*/`, tabs and whitespace runs collapse to single
spaces (`spm-pbxproj.js`'s `commentSafe`), falling back to the phase `id` —
normalized the same way — and then to no comment at all if nothing survives
either. Without that, a `{` in a comment would make the injector read the next
object's body as this one's, and a `,` would make `deinit` delete the wrong line
— corruption with no error. Only a line break is therefore rejected outright; a
name is a display name, and no Xcode phase name spans lines.

The injector's read of the sidecar is deliberately lenient — the file does not
exist yet on a first `spm add`, and a stale or hand-edited copy must not break
injection. An absent file yields no phases silently, an unparseable one warns,
and a single entry failing the same checks (bad or reserved `id`, empty or
multi-line `name`, missing `script`, unknown `position`, duplicate `id`) is
**skipped, never coerced** — the sidecar is the only gate on a hand edit, so it
enforces exactly the rules the plugin contract does.

**Gating is the script's job.** The phase runs for every configuration and
platform the target builds; if it should be a no-op for some of them (Release
only, simulator only, …), the script must check `$CONFIGURATION` /
`$PLATFORM_NAME` and exit early.

### Context (input)

| Field             | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `appRoot`         | The Xcode project directory (`<app>/ios`) being injected — **not** the app package root. Deriving package-root-relative paths from it (e.g. `path.join(appRoot, 'node_modules')`) silently breaks; use `projectRoot` for that. |
| `projectRoot`     | The JS root (nearest `package.json`) — where the framework scans `node_modules`.                                                                                                                                               |
| `reactNativeRoot` | Resolved `react-native` package root.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `autolinking`     | Parsed `autolinking.json` — RN's already-discovered deps, so the plugin can react to them.                                                                                                                                     |
| `outputDir`       | `build/generated/autolinking` — where generated artifacts land.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `react`           | How to depend on React (see below). `null` when there is no resolvable React dependency.                                                                                                                                       |

#### `context.react` — depending on React

A plugin that emits its own `Package.swift` must declare React as a dependency.
Rather than re-deriving React Native's package path, identity, and product names
— which differ between local and remote mode and **move as RN repackages** —
take them from `context.react`:

```js
react: {
  packageRef:
    {name: 'ReactNative', path: '<absolute>', relPath: '<relative-to-outputDir>'} // local
    | {name: '<identity>', url: '<url>', version: '<version>'},                   // remote (SPM-resolved)
  products: [
    {name: 'ReactHeaders', package: 'ReactNative'},
    {name: 'ReactNativeHeaders', package: 'ReactNative'},
    {name: 'ReactNativeDependenciesHeaders', package: 'ReactNative'},
    {name: 'ReactAppHeaders', package: 'React-GeneratedCode'}, // ← separate, per-app package
  ],
}
```

Local vs remote is signalled by which `packageRef` keys are present (`path` xor
`url`+`version`). `packageRef.path` is **absolute** — always correct no matter
which subdirectory of `outputDir` the plugin writes its own manifest into (the
generated manifests are gitignored and regenerated every sync, so there's no
portability cost); `relPath` (relative to `outputDir`) is provided as a
convenience. `products` is the set React Native wires into **its own**
autolinked targets (so a plugin's target compiles against exactly RN's React
surface), filtered to those resolvable this run — every listed product is safe
to reference without guarding. Note the fourth entry: `ReactAppHeaders` lives in
the separate `React-GeneratedCode` package (per-app codegen), which a
hand-rolled plugin would miss, and which is omitted when that package is absent.
Because RN derives this list from one source of truth alongside its own product
wiring, it stays correct across repackaging.

### Return (contributions, all optional)

| Field                 | Merged into                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `packageDependencies` | The aggregator's `.package(…)` list (`path`, or `url` + `version`).                                                                                    |
| `productDependencies` | The `AutolinkedAggregate` target's `dependencies:` (`.product(name:package:)`).                                                                        |
| `generatedSources`    | Recorded for the codegen step to register (e.g. a module-registry `.swift`).                                                                           |
| `flavoredFrameworks`  | Mandatory Debug/Release dynamic XCFramework pairs normalized outside SwiftPM. Malformed or incomplete entries are fatal.                               |
| `scriptPhases`        | Recorded for `spm add` / `update` to emit one `PBXShellScriptBuildPhase` per entry on the app target. Malformed entries and duplicate `id`s are fatal. |

The plugin returns **data** — it never writes into React Native's generated
tree. RN owns the merge, so a re-sync reproduces the same `Package.swift`
byte-for-byte (idempotent). Package and product contributions are **deduped by
name** across plugins.

## Lifecycle

```text
react-native spm add / update ─┐
                               ├─► generate-spm-autolinking main()
Xcode "Sync SPM Autolinking" ──┘        │
(build phase, every build)              ├─ 1. discover plugins (dep configs)
                                        ├─ 2. RN builds its own dep graph
                                        ├─ 3. invoke plugins (context in)
                                        └─ 4. merge results → aggregator Package.swift
```

Because steps 1–4 run in the one `main()`, everything above shares the same seam
— there is no separate hook to wire for the build-time path.

## Failure behavior

Fail-closed and **named**: a plugin that fails to load, doesn't export a
function, throws, or returns a malformed contribution aborts the run with a
message identifying the framework. A framework silently dropping its modules (a
green build missing native code) is worse than a loud stop.

  writes `.spm-plugin-generated-sources.json`; the `spm add`/`update` xcodeproj
  injector (generate-spm-xcodeproj.js) reads it and wires each source **into the
  app target** — a `PBXFileReference` + `PBXBuildFile` + a Sources-build-phase
  entry, parented under one "SPM Generated Sources" navigator group. This is
  what makes an `@objc` class (e.g. Expo's `ExpoModulesProvider`) reach the ObjC
  classlist: a class inside the static Autolinked aggregate never does, so
  `NSClassFromString` discovery would fail. Paths are stored SRCROOT-relative
  when under the app root (the usual `build/generated/…` case), else absolute
  (`sourceTree = "<absolute>"`). All UUIDs are namespaced on the normalized path
  (deterministic/idempotent) and recorded in the `.spm-injected.json` marker's
  `generatedSources` map, so `deinit` reverts them and `update` reconciles
  entries that left the manifest. A target without a Sources phase logs loudly
  and skips the wiring (injection otherwise succeeds). v1 targets only the
  injected app target and assumes `.swift` in practice (`.m`/`.mm` are mapped as
  future-proofing).
- **Implemented & tested:** `scriptPhases`, contract through injection.
  `invokePlugins` validates every entry fatally (`id` charset plus the reserved
  `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` names, a single-line `name`, a required
  `script`, the `position` enum, optional path lists and `alwaysOutOfDate`, plus
  duplicate `id`s), and the merge always rewrites
  `.spm-plugin-script-phases.json` — `[]` when no plugin declares any, so
  removing a plugin clears stale entries. The `spm add`/`update` xcodeproj
  injector reads that sidecar and emits one `PBXShellScriptBuildPhase` per entry
  on the app target at the requested position, recording the id→UUID map in the
  `.spm-injected.json` marker so a re-run refreshes each phase's content in
  place, re-seats it when its declared position or order changed, `update`
  removes phases that left the sidecar, and `deinit` reverts them. Like
  `flavoredFrameworks`, the build-time `sync` only rewrites the sidecar; it
  never mutates the project.
- **Co-design with Expo (not final):** codegen **provider ordering** — codegen
  must consume the same discovered module set the plugin contributes — is
  intentionally left for the first real plugin to drive to a stable shape.
- Contract to be ratified via RFC once Expo's plugin proves it (framed as a
  generic hook, not Expo-specific code in RN).
