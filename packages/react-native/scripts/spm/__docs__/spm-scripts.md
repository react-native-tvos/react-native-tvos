# SwiftPM Scripts – React Native iOS via Swift Package Manager (Preview)

> **Preview.** SwiftPM support is an early preview: the commands, flags,
> generated layout, and distribution model may change in future releases, and it
> is not yet recommended for production. Feedback is welcome. CocoaPods remains
> the supported default.

Build React Native iOS apps using **Swift Package Manager** with prebuilt
XCFrameworks, as an alternative to CocoaPods. It is **opt-in and additive** —
CocoaPods remains the default; `spm` injects into your existing `.xcodeproj` in
place and is fully reversible.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd ios

# First-time setup: injects SwiftPM packages into your existing MyApp.xcodeproj,
# in place. `npx react-native spm` with no action auto-resolves to `add` (or
# `update` once injected); on a fresh CocoaPods app it converts in one command
# (implies --deintegrate). To do it explicitly:
npx react-native spm add --deintegrate

# Open in Xcode (or `npm run ios`). Incremental dep changes auto-sync on build.
open MyApp.xcodeproj
```

After the initial run, the project carries **auto-sync hooks** that detect
dependency changes and re-run autolinking before compilation (see
[Auto-Sync](#auto-sync)) — you don't re-invoke `react-native spm` manually for
day-to-day dependency changes. **On a fresh clone or CI checkout, run
`npx react-native spm` once before building** (see
[Fresh clones & CI](#fresh-clones--ci)).

> **Note:** `react-native spm` is a thin wrapper over
> `node node_modules/react-native/scripts/setup-apple-spm.js`. If the CLI alias
> is unavailable in your environment, invoke the script directly with the same
> actions and the kebab-case flag equivalents (e.g. `--skip-codegen`).

## CocoaPods → SwiftPM migration

`spm add` injects into a project that is **not** CocoaPods-integrated. On a
CocoaPods app it fails loud and points you at `--deintegrate`, which:

1. runs `pod deintegrate` — removes CocoaPods integration from the `.xcodeproj`
   (Pods references, `[CP]` build phases, xcconfig links). Your `Podfile` is
   left on disk.
2. strips **only** the React Native directives (`use_react_native!`,
   `use_native_modules!`, `prepare_react_native_project!`) from the Podfile —
   every other line, **including your own `pod '…'` entries, is preserved**.
3. injects SwiftPM into the `.xcodeproj`.

React Native now comes from SwiftPM; no pods are linked yet (deintegrate removed
the integration).

### Keeping non-RN pods

Non-RN pods can stay side-by-side. After `spm add --deintegrate` your Podfile
still lists them (only the RN directives were removed) — re-integrate them with
a normal install:

```bash
pod install     # re-integrates the remaining (non-RN) pods; (re)creates the .xcworkspace
```

Then **open the `.xcworkspace`** (not the `.xcodeproj`): the workspace includes
the SwiftPM-injected project, so React Native resolves through SwiftPM and your
other pods through CocoaPods, together.

> **Do not re-add `use_react_native!`.** React Native must be provided by
> _either_ SwiftPM _or_ CocoaPods, never both — they share `build/generated/`,
> so a dual-managed RN does not build. `spm add` refuses to run while the
> Podfile still declares `use_react_native!`.

The migration is fully reversible — see
[Removing / resetting](#removing--resetting).

## Brownfield apps

`spm add` injects into your existing `.xcodeproj` in place, so an app that
embeds React Native works the same way — point it at the right project and
target:

```bash
npx react-native spm add --xcodeproj MyApp.xcodeproj --productName MyApp
```

**Requirement:** the `.xcodeproj` must live **inside the React Native JS tree**
— i.e. the app's `package.json` is a parent directory of the project. Both setup
and the build-time sync locate React Native by walking up from the project to
the nearest `package.json`. The common "native project at the repo root with the
RN JS in a sibling/child subfolder" layout is **not supported yet** — there is
no way to point at a JS root outside the project's ancestors.

Brownfield apps that keep CocoaPods for their other native dependencies follow
the [coexistence rules above](#keeping-non-rn-pods): React Native from SwiftPM,
everything else from CocoaPods, and no `use_react_native!` in the Podfile.

## CLI Actions

```bash
react-native spm [action] [options]
```

With no action, the command **auto-resolves**: if SwiftPM has been injected
(`.spm-injected.json` marker present) it routes to `update`; otherwise `add`. On
a freshly-scaffolded CocoaPods project (clean git tree, stock Podfile) the
zero-arg path additionally implies `--deintegrate` (the safe-gate), so
`npx react-native spm` converts a brand-new app to SwiftPM in one command.

When invoked from the JS root of a standard RN app (sibling `ios/` subdir), the
command auto-redirects into `ios/` with a banner.

| Action                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `add`                 | Inject SwiftPM packages (package refs, build settings, the Sync build phase) into the existing `.xcodeproj`, in place. Idempotent. Default on first run. `--deintegrate` first runs `pod deintegrate` + strips React Native from the Podfile. |
| `update`              | Re-run the pipeline and refresh the existing injection. Default once a project is injected.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `deinit`              | The inverse of `add`: surgically remove only what `add` injected (recorded in `.spm-injected.json`) and drop the marker. Git-recoverable; no prompt. Three things it does not undo — see [Files the tool touches](#files-the-tool-touches).   |
| `scaffold`            | Generate `Package.swift` into `node_modules/<dep>/` for community RN libraries that ship only a podspec.                                                                                                                                      |
| `sync` (advanced)     | Lightweight resync invoked by the Xcode auto-sync hooks. Regenerates invariant codegen and autolinking output only. Not for humans.                                                                                                           |
| `codegen` (advanced)  | Run codegen and install the SwiftPM codegen template only.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `download` (advanced) | Download/check xcframework artifacts only.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `--configCommand <json>`         | [advanced] JSON array of the argv used to generate `autolinking.json`, overriding the default `@react-native-community/cli config` command. Also settable via the `RCT_SPM_AUTOLINKING_CONFIG_COMMAND` env var. Either way the value is remembered, so you pass it once. Example: `'["npx","expo-modules-autolinking","react-native-config","--json","--platform","ios"]'` |

### The autolinking config command is remembered

An app that replaces `@react-native-community/cli` autolinking (an Expo app, for
example) has to tell `spm` how to produce `autolinking.json`. Pass the command
once, on `add` or `update`:

```bash
npx react-native spm add --configCommand '["npx","expo-modules-autolinking","react-native-config","--json","--platform","ios"]'
```

Every action that needs `autolinking.json` — `add`, `update`, `scaffold`, and
the build-time `sync` — resolves the command in this order:

1. `--configCommand`
2. `RCT_SPM_AUTOLINKING_CONFIG_COMMAND`
3. the `configCommand` pinned in `MyApp.xcodeproj/.spm-injected.json` by an
   earlier `add`/`update`
4. the default `@react-native-community/cli config`

`add`/`update` pin whichever of the first two routes supplied the command,
validated as an argv array; a later run that passes neither keeps the existing
pin, and passing `--configCommand` again replaces it. The pin exists because the
**Sync SPM Autolinking** build phase inherits neither your flag nor the shell
that exported the env var — without it, a successful `add` is followed by
failing builds, because the phase re-derives `autolinking.json` with the default
command. A pin never shadows the env var, so an override in your shell still
takes effect, and a pin that no longer parses is ignored in favor of the
default.

`deinit` deletes `.spm-injected.json`, and the pin with it. A later `add`
therefore falls back to the default command unless you pass `--configCommand`
(or export the env var) again.

### Pinning the React Native version

The resolved version selects **which artifact slots the project is wired to**,
so it has to stay the same from one run to the next. `--version` is therefore
recorded in the `.spm-injected.json` marker (as `artifactsVersionOverride`) and
read back by later runs, which resolve the version in this order:

1. an explicit `--version <ver>`,
2. the version a previous `--version` pinned into the marker,
3. `node_modules/react-native/package.json`.

So you pass the flag once, and a later flagless `add`/`update` stays on the
slots it selected. Without the pin, that flagless run falls back to
`package.json` and re-points the project at different artifact slots while the
marker still advertises the pinned version.

`deinit` deletes the marker, and with it the pin — a later `add` resolves
`node_modules/react-native/package.json` again unless you pass `--version`.

### Debug/Release flavor is automatic

React Native ships **flavored** prebuilt binaries: the _debug_ `React.framework`
(and `hermes-engine` / `ReactNativeDependencies`) carry the dev experience — dev
menu, assertions, `RN_DEBUG_STRING_CONVERTIBLE` — while _release_ strips them
for production. A Debug build must embed the debug binaries and a
Release/archive the release ones.

SwiftPM `binaryTarget`s can't branch on the build configuration, so runtime
frameworks are deliberately kept out of the package graph. `spm add` downloads
and validates **both** flavors into immutable app-local slots. It injects
SDK/architecture-qualified Xcode settings that link the exact selected binaries,
plus one phase that copies and signs the selected frameworks into the app.
Configurations containing `debug` or `development` select Debug; every other
configuration selects Release. Selection uses only generated build settings and
standard macOS tools: builds do not run Node, mutate symlinks, regenerate the
package graph, or require a second build.

Those same debug-flavored configurations also get
`SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS = "$(inherited) DEBUG"` — the only thing
that makes Swift's `#if DEBUG` true (`GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS` reaches
C/ObjC/C++ only), and what `AppDelegate.swift`'s `bundleURL()` branches on to
load from Metro instead of a bundled `main.jsbundle`. CocoaPods injects it at
`pod install` time, so this keeps SwiftPM apps at parity. An existing value is
left alone.

### iOS deployment target

Every manifest React Native generates — the `Autolinked` aggregate, the synth
package per dependency, and each scaffolded community package — declares the
same platform floor: your app's `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, never below React
Native's own minimum (15.1). SwiftPM refuses to link a product whose minimum is
higher than the target depending on it, so a dependency that needs more (Expo's
packages need iOS 16.4) only resolves once the app asks for at least as much:
raise the deployment target in Xcode and re-run `react-native spm update`.

A floor set in an `.xcconfig` your configuration is based on is honored,
`#include` chains included; one set through a build-setting variable
(`$(MY_FLOOR)`) is not, and falls back to React Native's minimum. `spm add` and
`spm update` also refresh the platform-floor line of existing scaffolded
manifests (they never create new ones) — if you persisted a scaffold with
`patch-package`, re-run `npx patch-package <dep>` afterwards.

Because `deinit` drops the marker, it drops both.

Injection is **purely additive** and **idempotent**: every other byte of your
project — signing, capabilities, your own Build Phases — stays untouched, and a
re-run is a no-op. The injected refs point at three stable sub-package paths
under `build/`, so adding or removing community deps changes the sub-package
contents (gitignored) and never re-injects. `deinit` removes exactly what was
injected, leaving the project byte-identical to its pre-`add` state — with the
exceptions called out above, and one more described next.

**Build settings that already exist** are edited in place. The four array
settings `add` merges into — `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`, `OTHER_LDFLAGS`,
`FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS`, `LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS` — keep the shape they were
written in: Xcode's multi-line form as well as the compact one-line form hand
edits and other generators (XcodeGen, Tuist) emit. One that exists as a plain
_scalar_ is promoted to a `( … )` array — the shape an Xcode-authored target can
carry, e.g. a
`LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS = "$(inherited) @executable_path/Frameworks";` written
as a scalar rather than a list. `add` records the pre-injection value in the
marker and `deinit` restores it by rewriting the whole field — once folded
together, the injected members and your own are indistinguishable — so **members
you add to a promoted array by hand afterwards are lost**. That applies to
`update` too, which reverts to the recorded baseline before re-injecting.

## Fresh clones & CI

Everything under `build/` is gitignored, so a clean checkout has no resolvable
Swift packages until they are regenerated. Xcode resolves the package graph
before build phases **and** before scheme pre-actions, so neither
[auto-sync hook](#auto-sync) can rescue this: with `build/generated/autolinking`
missing, the build stops at _"Resolve Package Graph … doesn't exist"_ having run
neither hook.

Verified on Xcode 26.6 against a freshly-injected app with `build/` deleted:
`xcodebuild -scheme … build` fails in nine lines of log, with
`Resolve Package Graph` as the first step and no trace of the pre-action;
`xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies` fails identically. Opening the project
in Xcode also resolves the graph on load, before you press Build.

So run the setup command once after cloning, before building — the SwiftPM
analog of `pod install`:

```bash
npx react-native spm      # downloads artifacts (if missing) + regenerates build/
```

On an already-injected project this routes to `update`: it fetches the
xcframework artifacts into the shared cache if they aren't present and
regenerates `build/xcframeworks` + `build/generated`. After this first run,
incremental dependency changes are picked up automatically by the auto-sync
hooks.

**Automate it** so nobody has to remember — add a `postinstall` hook, which runs
as part of the `npm install` / `yarn install` your CI already does before
`xcodebuild`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "react-native spm"
  }
}
```

`npx react-native spm` auto-redirects from the JS root into `ios/`, so the hook
works from the app root; in CI (non-interactive) it proceeds without prompting.
It re-runs the full pipeline (codegen + an idempotent re-inject that is a no-op
when nothing changed), so it is slightly heavier than the internal `sync` the
build phase calls — a fine trade for not having to remember a command.

> A future remote-package distribution (a tagged `Package.swift` repo +
> `binaryTarget(url:checksum:)`) removes this step entirely: SwiftPM resolves
> and fetches the artifacts itself during normal package resolution. Until then,
> the one-time setup run is required on clean machines.

## Local Native Modules

Modules not discovered via autolinking are declared in the app's package.json.
Each `path` is relative to the file that declares it — the project root for a
package.json there, the Xcode project directory for a config kept there:

```json
{
  "swiftpmConfig": {
    "modules": [
      {
        "name": "MyNativeModule",
        "path": "ios/MyNativeModule",
        "exclude": ["*.podspec"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each entry becomes a target in `build/generated/autolinking/Package.swift`.
Sources outside `build/generated/autolinking/` are automatically mirrored with
file-level symlinks.

## Where SwiftPM settings live

A package's SwiftPM settings live under `swiftpmConfig` in its **package.json**,
alongside `codegenConfig`.

| Field               | Set by  | What it does                                                |
| ------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`              | library | Its SwiftPM target name, and so its header import prefix    |
| `dependencies`      | library | npm names of native libraries it builds against             |
| `autolinkingPlugin` | library | Path to an [autolinking plugin](spm-autolinking-plugins.md) |
| `scaffold`          | library | `false` opts the library out of `spm scaffold`              |
| `modules`           | app     | [Local native modules](#local-native-modules) to build      |
| `denyPlugins`       | app     | npm names whose autolinking plugin to skip                  |

```json
{
  "swiftpmConfig": {
    "name": "RNSVG",
    "dependencies": ["react-native-worklets"]
  }
}
```

A library's settings come from its own package.json. An **app's** are resolved
field by field, each from the directory holding its package.json — the JS root,
where codegen reads `codegenConfig` — falling back to the Xcode project
directory. An unrecognised field is ignored with a warning naming it, so a typo
does not pass silently.

These settings used to live in an `spm` block in `react-native.config.js`. That
block is **deprecated** but still read, with the same field names, so nothing
breaks: move the keys across as they are, and package.json wins field by field.
`npx react-native spm scaffold` writes the `name` for you — see
[Community packages without a Package.swift](#community-packages-without-a-packageswift).

## Library names

An autolinked library's SwiftPM target name is also the prefix its headers are
imported under (`#import <RNSVG/…>`), so it is not cosmetic: it has to be the
prefix the library's own sources and its dependents already use.

It is resolved in this order:

1. `swiftpmConfig.name` in the library's package.json
2. `spm.name` in `react-native.config.js` (deprecated)
3. podspec `header_dir` — `React-Core` → `React`
4. podspec `module_name` — a distinct declared module (`react-native-foo-bar` →
   `RNFooBar`)
5. podspec name — `react-native-svg` → `RNSVG`
6. npm package name — `react-native-svg` → `ReactNativeSvg`

Steps 3–5 are a **migration path, not the destination**. They exist so that
libraries work unchanged today, a podspec being what they already ship, and
`npx react-native spm scaffold` closes them out: it records the name it derived
as `swiftpmConfig.name` in the library's package.json, after which the podspec
is never consulted for naming again. A library that declares its own name needs
no podspec for SwiftPM at all.

Within those three steps, `header_dir` comes first because that is what a
library sets when its import prefix differs from its pod name, then
`module_name`, what CocoaPods compiles the module as and so what Swift and
`@import` consumers write. But a `header_dir` only a **subspec** declares names
that subspec's headers, not the library, so the pod name stands
(react-native-svg is `RNSVG`, not `rnsvg`; its subspec prefix resolves through
the header search paths instead) — unless the subspec reuses the parent's block
variable (`do |s|`), which hides which scope declared what, so the podspec is
read by CocoaPods or not at all. An unreadable podspec falls through rather than
failing the build — with a warning, since a machine that can read it (one with
CocoaPods installed) may resolve a different name. A prefix Swift cannot spell
is normalized — `Some.Pod` becomes `Some_Pod`, what SwiftPM would compile it as
anyway — with a warning naming `swiftpmConfig.name`.

Two names are refused outright: one React Native reserves (`ReactNative`,
`ReactHeaders`, `ReactNativeHeaders`, `ReactNativeDependenciesHeaders`,
`ReactAppHeaders`, `React-GeneratedCode`, `ReactCodegen`,
`ReactAppDependencyProvider`, `Autolinked`), and one another library already
took. Both are **hard errors** naming `swiftpmConfig.name` — nothing is renamed
automatically, because a name the build invented is one no `#import` in your
sources can predict. Two names must differ by more than case or punctuation to
be two targets: `worklets` and `Worklets` share a headers directory, and
`foo-bar` and `foo_bar` are one module, since SwiftPM replaces every character
C99 rejects with `_`.

## Dependencies between libraries

SwiftPM has no equivalent of a podspec's `s.dependency`, so a library that needs
another native library declares it explicitly in its **own** package.json — a
list of npm names:

```json
// react-native-reanimated/package.json
{
  "swiftpmConfig": {"dependencies": ["react-native-worklets"]}
}
```

The autolinker follows these **recursively** from the directly-autolinked deps
and dedupes, so a transitive dependency joins the package graph even when the
app never depends on it directly.

### Config module format

`react-native.config.js` may be CommonJS or ESM, and both named and default
exports are read. A key defined twice — as a named export and on the default
export — resolves to the named one. Avoid that shape anyway: the Community CLI
has two loaders that disagree about it, a sync one that sees named exports and
an async one that takes only the default export. For maximum compatibility,
prefer the one-line CommonJS form:

```js
module.exports = {dependency: {platforms: {ios: {}}}};
```

If the config fails to load, a warning names the file and the reason — any
deprecated `spm` settings in it are ignored rather than silently applied.

## Self-managed community packages

A community library that ships its own `Package.swift` is referenced directly by
the autolinker instead of being wrapped. To keep SwiftPM's package identity
(which it derives from the path basename) unique across deps — even when several
libs put their manifest inside an `ios/` subdir — each self-managed dep is
exposed through a uniquely-named symlink at
`build/generated/autolinking/libs/<SwiftName>/`. The aggregator `Package.swift`
references that path, so two libs both shipping `<dep>/ios/Package.swift` never
collide on identity `"ios"`.

The `libs/` directory is wiped and recreated on every autolinker run, so
deleting a dep via `npm uninstall` cleans up the alias automatically on the next
build.

## Community packages without a Package.swift

If an autolinked library ships **no `Package.swift`**, `spm add`/`update` stops
with a per-dep error (`Package.swift is missing for library "<name>"`) and exits
**2** — a distinct code from a generic failure, so CI and the Xcode sync hooks
can treat it as a hard error while staying lenient about transient sync
failures.

`add` and `update` deliberately **never** scaffold on your behalf:
auto-scaffolding would hide a real gap in the dependency's SPM support. Generate
the manifest from the library's podspec explicitly, then re-run setup:

```bash
npx react-native spm scaffold      # writes Package.swift into node_modules/<dep>/
npx react-native spm               # then inject/update as usual
```

(`scaffold` also runs codegen and regenerates the autolinking package, but it
does not inject into the `.xcodeproj` — so on a first-time setup you still
follow it with `npx react-native spm`.)

`scaffold` also records the name it derived from the podspec as
`swiftpmConfig.name` in the library's package.json — the one step that lets the
library be named without reading a podspec at all. It never overwrites a name
the library already declares, and it says which packages it edited. Every
library it scaffolds gets a line naming the SwiftPM name it chose and where that
name came from, plus a note when a podspec's `header_dir` and `module_name`
disagree about it and only one can win.

Because `node_modules/` isn't committed, persist both so they survive the next
install:

```bash
npx patch-package <dep>            # then commit the generated patch
```

**Better: contribute the manifest upstream.** The generated `Package.swift` is a
normal, committable manifest — the ideal fix is for the library to ship it
itself, so every consumer gets SwiftPM support without a local patch. Please
**file an issue or open a PR on the library** with the scaffolded
`Package.swift` (mention it was generated by `react-native spm scaffold` for
React Native SwiftPM support). Until it lands upstream, the `patch-package`
workaround keeps your app building.

## Framework plugins (Preview)

Frameworks with their own module system (e.g. Expo) contribute to the
autolinking graph through a **plugin** — a function invoked on every
regeneration (including the build-time sync) that adds SwiftPM package refs,
product dependencies, and generated sources. Discovery is transitive (installing
the framework is enough), and the plugin returns data that RN merges
idempotently.

See **[spm-autolinking-plugins.md](./spm-autolinking-plugins.md)** for the
discovery mechanism, the full context/return contract, lifecycle, and failure
behavior.

## Removing / resetting

To remove SwiftPM entirely, use `deinit` (the inverse of `add`):

```bash
react-native spm deinit   # surgically removes everything `add` injected
pod install               # then, to restore CocoaPods
```

To reset the regenerable build state (without un-injecting), just delete the
gitignored dirs and re-run:

```bash
rm -rf build/xcframeworks build/generated .build
react-native spm update
```

Xcode's "Clean Build Folder" (Cmd+Shift+K) only removes DerivedData — it does
not touch SwiftPM-generated directories. The cached xcframework slot is shared
across apps; refresh it with `react-native spm update --download force`.

### Pipeline

`react-native spm add` and `react-native spm update` orchestrate these steps:

| Step           | Script                                   | Output                                                                                            |

| 1. CLI config  | `spm/generate-spm-autolinking-config.js` | `build/generated/autolinking/autolinking.json`                                                    |
| 2. Codegen     | `generate-codegen-artifacts.js`          | `build/generated/ios/`                                                                            |
| 3. Autolinking | `spm/generate-spm-autolinking.js`        | `build/generated/autolinking/Package.swift`                                                       |
| 4. Download    | `spm/download-spm-artifacts.js`          | Complete Debug and Release cache slots                                                            |
| 5. Package     | `spm/generate-spm-package.js`            | Immutable flavor slots, central manifest, canonical `ReactHeaders`, and invariant `Package.swift` |
| 6. Inject      | `spm/generate-spm-xcodeproj.js`          | Invariant SwiftPM products plus configuration-qualified linker settings and the embed/sign phase  |
| Auto-sync      | `spm/sync-spm-autolinking.js`            | Re-runs invariant codegen/autolinking output only at Xcode build time                             |

```

### Header Resolution

React Native uses CocoaPods-style imports (`#import <React/RCTBridge.h>`) that
SwiftPM doesn't natively support. The prebuilt artifacts serve them through
SwiftPM package products — no `-I` search-path flags, and no clang VFS overlay:

1. **`<React/…>` and `import React`** resolve through the invariant
   **`ReactHeaders` Clang target**. It stages one canonical header copy after
   proving Debug and Release expose identical public headers, and uses a plain
   `module React` module map with `React/`-prefixed paths.
2. **Lowercase C++ `react/` and every other RN namespace** (`yoga/`, `jsi/`,
   `jsinspector-modern`, …) comes from **`ReactNativeHeaders.xcframework`**, a
   headers-only (LIBRARY-type) binaryTarget whose per-slice `Headers/` SwiftPM
   auto-serves to dependents.
3. **Third-party dependency namespaces** (`folly/`, `glog/`, `boost/`, `fmt/`,
   `double-conversion/`, `fast_float/`, `SocketRocket/`) come from
   **`ReactNativeDependenciesHeaders.xcframework`**, the deps headers-only
   sidecar (same mechanism — the binary `ReactNativeDependencies.xcframework` is
   framework-type and can't expose those headers to SwiftPM).

Targets that compile against React take these as product dependencies
(`ReactHeaders`, `ReactNativeHeaders`, `ReactNativeDependenciesHeaders`, plus
the app's `ReactAppHeaders`), so all of the above resolve with zero search-path
flags.

### Auto-Sync

Autolinking is kept up to date without manual re-runs of `react-native spm` by
**two hooks running the same sync script**, injected by `add`/`update`:

| Hook                               | Where                                                                                       | Role                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scheme pre-action                  | The app's **shared** scheme (`xcshareddata/xcschemes/`), under `BuildAction` → `PreActions` | Fires earlier in the build than a build phase can, so it is the one that normally does the re-sync. |
| `Sync SPM Autolinking` build phase | `.xcodeproj`, prepended before `Sources`                                                    | **Safety net** for builds that bypass the scheme (and for a scheme whose pre-action was stripped).  |

Neither hook can bootstrap a clean checkout. Xcode resolves the Swift package
graph before build phases **and** before scheme pre-actions, so if the generated
packages are missing entirely, resolution fails and the build stops before
either hook runs — see [Fresh clones & CI](#fresh-clones--ci). The hooks keep an
_existing_ set of generated packages current; they do not create the first one.

**How the sync script works:**

1. Compares timestamps of staleness inputs against
   `build/generated/autolinking/.spm-sync-stamp`:
   - `package.json` — dependency declarations
   - `react-native.config.js` — autolinking config
   - `node_modules/` directory mtime — updated by any package manager (npm,
     yarn, pnpm, bun); also checks parent `node_modules` for monorepo setups
   - a missing `build/xcframeworks/` (e.g. after a manual clean) also marks
     stale
   - every path in `.spm-sync-watch-paths` — RN's own inputs plus any
     [plugin](./spm-autolinking-plugins.md#watchpaths--plugin-staleness-inputs)
     `watchPaths`; a watched file that is newer, a watched dir with a newer
     child, or a watched path that has **vanished** all mark stale
2. If any input is newer (or the stamp is missing): runs
   `npx react-native spm sync`, which re-executes autolinking + package
   generation (downloading artifacts if the cache slot is incomplete) and writes
   the stamp file.
3. If all inputs are fresh: exits immediately (~1ms).

**Ordering.** As observed in an `xcodebuild -scheme … build` log on Xcode 26.6:

| Step                                            | Owner             |

| Resolve Package Graph                           | Xcode             |
| **Sync SPM Autolinking**                        | scheme pre-action |
| Prepare packages / ComputeTargetDependencyGraph | Xcode             |
| CreateBuildDescription                          | Xcode             |
| **Sync SPM Autolinking** (safety net)           | build phase 1     |

Resolution coming first is what makes the one-time setup run necessary on a
clean checkout; it is not something either hook can work around.

A sync failure is lenient by default but **not unconditionally**. The generated
script branches on the exit code:

- **Exit 2** — an autolinked dependency ships no `Package.swift`. This **fails
  the build** (`exit 1`), deliberately: the autolinker has already printed an
  `error:` line per dep, and the fix needs a terminal (see
  [Community packages without a Package.swift](#community-packages-without-a-packageswift)).
- **Any other non-zero exit** — emits
  `warning: SPM sync failed — build may use stale codegen/autolinking` and lets
  the build continue, so an already-generated package graph can still produce a
  successful build.

That split is the whole reason the missing-manifest case has its own exit code:
a transient sync hiccup should not break a build that could still succeed, while
a genuinely missing manifest should not pass silently.
