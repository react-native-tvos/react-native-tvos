# Facade podspecs for the prebuilt React Native Core path.
#
# In prebuilt mode the compiled code AND headers for the React core pods live
# entirely inside React.xcframework + React-Core-prebuilt (which flattens the
# ReactNativeHeaders namespaces into its Headers/). Re-installing the SOURCE
# podspecs in that mode is what makes them ship duplicate headers that shadow the
# prebuilt artifact (via HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS, CocoaPods .hmap header maps, and
# the all-product-headers VFS overlay) and break the React framework's clang
# explicit-module precompile.
#
# Instead we install dependency-only FACADE podspecs for those names: they ship
# no source files and (with one narrow exception, see FACADE_REEXPOSED_HEADERS)
# no headers, so CocoaPods makes them PBXAggregateTarget
# placeholders (should_build? == false) and nothing is laid down to shadow. Each
# facade depends on React-Core-prebuilt so its consumers transitively pick up the
# prebuilt framework + headers. The pod NAMES still resolve, so ReactCodegen,
# third-party modules, and RN's own podspec graph keep resolving `React-Core`,
# `Yoga`, `React-Core/Default`, etc.
#
# MAINTENANCE MODEL: the set of facaded pods is explicit (FACADE_PODS) so the
# prebuilt rollout can be staged, but each facade's VERSION and SUBSPECS are
# DERIVED from the real podspec at `pod install` time (Pod::Specification.from_file).
# That removes the drift risk that would otherwise bite third-party libraries:
# if React adds/renames `React-Core/<Subspec>`, the facade exposes it
# automatically — nobody has to hand-maintain a parallel subspec list.
#
# This is staged: phase 1 facades a small set and KEEPS the existing
# podspec_sources / add_rncore_dependency / configure_aggregate_xcconfig /
# -fmodule-map-file machinery. The set is expanded until the cold prebuilt
# build passes; the distributed prebuilt helpers are only deleted afterwards.

    # add_rncore_dependency belongs here — e.g. ReactCodegen depends on the
    # prebuilt but still builds its own generated sources, so it is NOT a facade.)

    # because they reach unguarded C++ and are excluded from the framework module
    # map) and are NOT in the flattened React-Core-prebuilt/Headers. A quoted

    # maps carry it again, exactly as the source pod did.
